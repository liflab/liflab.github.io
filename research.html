<h1>Research at LIF</h1>

<p>The <strong>Formal Computer Science Laboratory</strong> (in French: <em>Laboratoire d&rsquo;informatique formelle</em> or LIF) is a research group based in the Department of Computer Science and Mathematics at <a href="https://www.uqac.ca/">Universit&eacute; du Qu&eacute;bec &agrave; Chicoutimi</a>. Faculty and students work on applied research projects combining mathematics and computer systems. Projets led at LIF are funded by both public programs and contributions from the industry.</p>

<h2>Expertise</h2>

<p>At LIF, we develop new techniques to discover or prevent bugs in computer systems. The expertise of our researchers and students revolves around the following axes:</p>

<ul>
<li>computer security, and in particular the detection of attacks and faults in real time</li>
<li>software testing and verification: how to speed up or even automate the discovery of bugs in a system under development</li>
</ul>

<p>These axes are the source of multiple projects, applied to web applications, network management, video game development and Complex Event Processing, among other things.</p>

<h2>Awards</h2>

<p>The students and researchers at LIF conduct cutting-edge research, which earned them numerous awards. In the past years, four research papers published by LIF have won the <strong>Best Paper Award</strong> in an international conference. One of the software tools developed at LIF also won the <strong>Best Tool Paper Award</strong> in 2015 at the International Conference on Software Testing held in Graz, Austria.</p>

<p>Moreover, students working at LIF have earned multiple grands and prizes; for example, a fourth position at the D&eacute;fi Coveo Blitz and a second position at the 2014 CS Games 2014, as well as various excellence scholarships from NSERC and Fonds recherche Qu&eacute;bec. Two of LIF's faculty have also received the Governor General of Canada&rsquo;s Academic Medal.</p>

<h2>Team</h2>

<p>Founded in 2012 by two UQAC professors, LIF has enjoyed a steady growth ever since. At the moment, three professors of Computer Science conduct research at LIF, where they supervise students at the undergraduate, M.Sc. and Ph.D. level.</p>

<p>The LIF&rsquo;s premises are located in Chicoutimi (Qu&eacute;bec) in UQAC&rsquo;s Main Building. They can accommodate up to fifteen workstations in an open and laid-back environment.</p>
