<p>The Formal Computing Laboratory at the University of Qu&eacute;bec in Chicoutimi is seeking excellent master&rsquo;s candidates for a 2-year funded project on the monitoring of the video game economy.</p>

<ul>
<li>Start date: September 1, 2024 (or later)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Description</h2>

<p>One possible way to ensure the balance of a video game is to model its &ldquo;economy&rdquo; (i.e., the mechanism by which resources are distributed, acquired, or spent within the game&rsquo;s universe) using a simulator, and then generate a large number of simulated runs to collect statistics. For example, if it is found that 90% of simulations end in failure, or result in the depletion of a resource necessary for the continuation of the game, one could seek to adjust the economy&rsquo;s parameters to reduce its difficulty level.</p>

<p>The software machinations.io is a popular and very flexible game economy simulator that allows modeling a variety of game types. The first objective of this project is to learn how to use the software, model simple game economies, run simulations, and understand the statistical calculation features offered by the software. A second objective of the project involves exporting real-time data produced by the economy simulation outside the software, and linking it as a data source to the BeepBeep event stream processing library for simple transformations.</p>

<h2>Funding</h2>

<p>$21,000 per year for a period of two years</p>

<h2>Research Areas</h2>

<ul>
<li>Video games</li>
<li>Log analysis</li>
</ul>

<h2>Host Institution and Laboratory Presentation</h2>

<p>The University of Qu&eacute;bec in Chicoutimi (UQAC) is part of the largest university network in Canada. It is located in the Francophone region of Saguenay&ndash;Lac-Saint-Jean, known for the beauty of its fjord and the majesty of its surrounding nature. UQAC welcomes 6,500 students annually, including more than 1,000 from 50 different countries. The computer science research program is particularly dynamic; it hosts two Canada Research Chairs, currently includes about twenty professors, 30 doctoral and postdoctoral fellows, and more than 100 master&rsquo;s students.</p>

<p>The doctoral work will take place at the Formal Computing Laboratory, under the supervision of Prof. Sylvain Hall&eacute;, holder of the Canada Research Chair in Testing, Specification, and Verification of Computer Systems. The LIF specializes in the application of formal methods to testing and verification of various software systems. Previous projects by LIF faculty members have been carried out in collaboration with numerous companies, including Ericsson, Industrial Alliance, Ubisoft LaForge, Devicom, and Eckinox Media.</p>

<p>Research at LIF is internationally recognized and contributes to the development of concrete, high-quality software tools based on solid mathematical foundations. Notable long-standing projects developed at LIF include the BeepBeep 3 event stream processing engine, the Artichoke blockchain monitoring system, and the Petit Poucet data lineage library. All these initiatives have been awarded and published at leading international conferences over the last decade.
Candidate Profile</p>

<p>A very good university master&rsquo;s degree in computer science, management information systems, mathematics, or a related discipline is expected. In addition, we are looking for the following qualifications:</p>

<ul>
<li>Good programming skills (Python, C#, C++)</li>
<li>Knowledge of video game development or Java programming will be considered as assets</li>
<li>Skills in scientific communication and writing.</li>
<li>Strong interest in scientific problems and motivation to conduct independent and focused research.</li>
</ul>

<p>The University of Qu&eacute;bec in Chicoutimi is committed to equity, diversity, and inclusion at all stages of its students&rsquo; curriculum; individuals from underrepresented groups are particularly encouraged to apply. Applications will be evaluated by a panel of three faculty members of UQAC focusing on the above criteria. Initially selected individuals will be invited for an online interview to further assess their technical and communication skills.</p>

<h2>Application Materials</h2>

<p>Individuals wishing to apply are invited to fill out the online form at the address https://zfrmz.com/BGLMrz4QFYzkIOZxVtpD?lang=en, making sure to select the LIF24-M1 contest and providing the following documents:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cover letter</li>
<li>Curriculum vitae, including a) list of publications if applicable; b) names and contact information of at least two references</li>
<li>Transcripts from the bachelor&rsquo;s (license) and master&rsquo;s (master) degrees</li>
</ul>
